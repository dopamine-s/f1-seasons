          Brazilian race car driver Ayrton Senna was born on 21 March 1960 in
          the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of Santana, a neighborhood of São
          Paulo. He was a Brazilian racing driver who won three Formula One
          world championships for McLaren in 1988, 1990 and 1991 and is widely
          regarded as one of the greatest Formula One driver of all time. He
          died in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix for
          Williams. Three-times Formula One champion, Ayrton Senna was one of
          the world’s greatest racers of all time. Starting off at the tender
          age of thirteen, he rose to prominence in no time and became the
          undisputed champion of Formula One racing. Senna began his motorsport
          career in karting, moved up to open-wheel racing in 1981, and won the
          1983 British Formula Three Championship. He made his Formula One debut
          with Toleman-Hart in 1984, before moving to Lotus-Renault the
          following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three
          seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda.
          Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year,
          and Senna claimed his first World Championship. Prost claimed the
          championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in
          1990 and 1991. In 1992, the Williams-Renault combination began to
          dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the 1993
          season as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to
          Williams in 1994. (21-year old Senna in his British Formula Ford 1600
          single seater.) However, the steep climb towards success did not last
          long as a tragic accident cost him his life. It was during the race at
          the San Marino Grand Prix that Senna lost his life in what is said to
          be one of the most fatal Formula One accidents. His death raised many
          questions over the safety concerns and reforms in Formula One. A
          legend in the making, Senna at the time of his death had successfully
          achieved a total of 65 pole positions. He was immensely dedicated to
          his profession and took part in some of the most controversial races
          with France’s Alain Prost and England’s Nigel Mansel. Amazingly, it
          took a total of 12 years for the acclaimed racer Michael Schumacher to
          beat Senna’s record. Senna has often been voted as the best and most
          influential Formula One driver of all time in various motorsport
          polls. He was recognized for his qualifying speed over one lap, and
          from 1989 until 2006 he held the record for most pole positions. He
          was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the 1984
          Monaco Grand Prix, the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the 1993
          European Grand Prix. He holds a record six victories at the Monaco
          Grand Prix and is the fifth-most successful driver of all time in
          terms of race wins. Senna courted controversy throughout his career,
          particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Prost. In the Japanese
          Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990, each of which decided the championship
          of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the
          eventual winner.
